Nowadays developers use many Js framework to develop this type of Web Apps, like as NPM Package Manager which is used for Node JS for a different module. But we have developed this very simple Web App for Capturing ScreenShot of any Content in a WebPage Using JS vanilla and Jquery. The need for this functionality came about on one of our projects “MyFlatz”; It’s an online gaming platform on which there is also an editor “Studio” where users can take a final ScreenShot of his own personal Flatz (which is the term that we give to custom playing cards).
Software Requirements:
Editor: Sublime Text, Programming Language: Vanilla JS, Jquery, HTML, Web Browser: I have used Mozilla Firefox Developer Edition but there is no recitation we can use any browser to run this tool.
